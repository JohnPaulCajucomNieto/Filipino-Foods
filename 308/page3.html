          1 large onion, quartered and sliced

          ⅔ cup low sodium soy sauce
          ⅓ cup white vinegar

        <td class="RK">
          Pan-fry the chicken pieces for 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side. This will
          partially cook the outer part. It also makes the skin tough enough to
          withstand stewing later. This means that it will remain intact, which
          is nice for presentation. Pour marinade into the pot and add water.
          Let boil. The bay leaves and whole peppercorn can now be added. The
          process takes 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quality of the
          chicken. However, feel free to cook longer in low heat for a super
          tender chicken adobo. Add the vinegar. This can also be added as a
          part of the marinade. Let it cook for 10 minutes

        <td class="RK">6</td>
        <td class="RK">The cooking method for the Philippine adobo is indigenous to the Philippines. The various precolonial peoples of the country often cooked or prepared their food with vinegar and salt to preserve them in the tropical climate. Vinegar, in particular, is one of the most important ingredients in Filipino cuisine, with the main traditional types being coconut, cane, nipa palm, and kaong palm.</td>

        <td class="R">
          Start by boiling around 2 quarts of water in a pot. I add the daikon
          radish, tomato, and onion once the water starts to boil. Continue to
          cook for 5 to 8 minutes. The fresh shrimp is added afterwards. Make
          sure to clean the shrimp before cooking. Wash the shrimp thoroughly
          and devein, if possible. Fresh shrimp with head attached is perfect
          for sinigang. The head is full of flavorful. It helps improve the
          taste of the broth.Add the souring agent and then continue to cook the
          shrimp for 3 minutes. I am using Knorr Sinigang sa Sampaloc Recipe Mix
          whenever I cook sinigang.

        <td class="KR">The exact origins of sinigang are unknown, but it is believed to have originated in the Philippines when the Malay first stepped foot on the Islands of the Philippines1. Sinigang is a sour tasting soup that is usually served as a main dish with rice2. While present nationwide, sinigang is seen to be culturally Tagalog in origin, thus the similar sour stews and soups found in the Visayas and Mindanao are regarded as different dishes and differ in the ingredients used3</td>

        <td class="RK">
          Prepare the meat by boiling it along with chopped onion. This will
          make it tender while providing flavor at the same time. Oxtail needs
          to be very tender for best results. It takes around 3 hours to boil
          when cooking using the traditional method. A quicker way is to use a
          pressure cooker. It cuts the cooking time by more than half. The
          peanut sauce can make or break your dish. It is important to have the
          proper ratio of ingredients to be able to achieve the ideal
          consistency of the sauce. It should not be too thick or very thin. I
          use both peanut butter and crushed peanuts to make the sauce.

        <td class="RK">Kare kare is a traditional Filipino dish that has several possible origins. It is believed to have been invented in Pampanga, the culinary epicenter of the Philippines, and was originally a traditional dish of the Moro people, the native inhabitants of the archipelago. Another theory is that it was an attempt by Indian soldiers on British ships trying to recreate curry far from home using local annatto seeds and peanuts. Nowadays, it is often served at numerous Filipino festivities</td>

          sliced, 1/4 cup cooking oil, ⅔ cup green olives, salt and pepper to
          taste
        </td>
        <td class="R">
          The first part of the process is to sauté beef with garlic and onion.
          Start by heating oil in wide pot. Cook the garlic, onion, and beef.
          Continue to saute the beef until the color browns a bit. Add bay
          leaves and crushed peppercorn. Continue by adding liver spread, tomato
          sauce, and beef broth.The beef needs to be cooked until tender. You
          can do it the traditional way by cooking it in a regular cooking pot
          over the stove top. This takes around 60 to 90 minutes. A faster way
          to tenderize beef is to cook it using a pressure cooker. It can save
          you time by more than half. Go ahead and add the vegetables and
          seasonings. Cook for around 10 minutes and it’s done.

        <td class="KR">Kaldereta is a Filipino meat stew that is traditionally served with a side of white rice1. The dish is influenced by three centuries of Spanish colonization, and the word kaldereta is derived from the Spanish caldereta, meaning cooking pot or cauldron213. The dish is similar to meat stews from the Iberian Peninsula and was brought to the Philippines by the Spaniards during their 300-year occupation of the Philippines</td>

        </td>
        <td class="RK" > Marinate In Soy Sauce And Calamansi The process requires the beef to
            be marinated in soy sauce and calamansi juice. This step helps infuse
            flavors to the meat. I use dark soy sauce for this recipe. You should
            be able to use light soy sauce without issues. Calamansi or calamondin
            is best use for this dish. However, lemon or lime can be used as
            alternative ingredients. Simply combine soy sauce, calamansi juice,
            and ground black pepper in a bowl. Add beef slices. Marinate for 1
            hour. It will be better if you can place everything in a resealable
            ziplock bag and let all the air out before sealing.
